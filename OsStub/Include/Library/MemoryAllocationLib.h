  Provides services to allocate and free memory buffers of various memory types and alignments.

  The Memory Allocation Library abstracts various common memory allocation operations. This library
  allows code to be written in a phase-independent manner because the allocation of memory in PEI, DXE,
  and SMM (for example) is done via a different mechanism. Using a common library interface makes it
  much easier to port algorithms from phase to phase.

  Allocates a buffer of type EfiBootServicesData.

  Allocates the number bytes specified by AllocationSize of type EfiBootServicesData and returns a
  pointer to the allocated buffer.  If AllocationSize is 0, then a valid buffer of 0 size is
  returned.  If there is not enough memory remaining to satisfy the request, then NULL is returned.

  @param  AllocationSize        The number of bytes to allocate.

  @return A pointer to the allocated buffer or NULL if allocation fails.

  Allocates and zeros a buffer of type EfiBootServicesData.

  Allocates the number bytes specified by AllocationSize of type EfiBootServicesData, clears the
  buffer with zeros, and returns a pointer to the allocated buffer.  If AllocationSize is 0, then a
  valid buffer of 0 size is returned.  If there is not enough memory remaining to satisfy the

  Frees a buffer that was previously allocated with one of the pool allocation functions in the
  Memory Allocation Library.

  Frees the buffer specified by Buffer.  Buffer must have been allocated on a previous call to the
  pool allocation services of the Memory Allocation Library.  If it is not possible to free pool
  resources, then this function will perform no actions.

  If Buffer was not allocated with a pool allocation function in the Memory Allocation Library,
  then ASSERT().

  @param  Buffer                Pointer to the buffer to free.
